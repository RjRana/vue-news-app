# Vue News App

The **Vue News App** is a modern and feature-rich web application that allows users to browse and read news articles from various sources. It is built using Vue.js 2.7 and takes advantage of the new script setup feature in some components to enhance code organization and readability. This project is designed to showcase my skills and expertise as a front-end developer.

## Key Features

- **Home Page for News Articles**: The application's home page displays a list of news articles from different sources in an organized and user-friendly manner.

- **History View**: Users can view a list of previously read articles in the history view, making it easy to revisit articles of interest.

- **Search Functionality**: The app provides a search feature that allows users to search for specific news articles based on keywords or topics.

- **Channel Selection**: Users can select their preferred news sources or channels to read news from, providing a personalized news reading experience.

- **Sub View for Detail Page**: When users click on a news article, a sub-view with detailed information about the article is displayed, providing a seamless and immersive reading experience.

- **Edit News Headline with Validation**: The application allows users to edit news headlines, and it ensures that any modifications comply with validation rules for data integrity.
